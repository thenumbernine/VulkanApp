Making a minimal test case of Vulkan on SDL.
Maybe I'll turn it into a Vulkan parent class or object or something.
Oh what's that, there is no internal compiler into SPIR-V?  You have to use 3rd party tools?  Considering what a mess the consistence of any GLSL driver is across OS's even within the same GPU company, I can't say I'm surprised.
So now how in the world do I get my hands on glslc or clspv?
Hmm looks interesting: https://github.com/google/clspv
